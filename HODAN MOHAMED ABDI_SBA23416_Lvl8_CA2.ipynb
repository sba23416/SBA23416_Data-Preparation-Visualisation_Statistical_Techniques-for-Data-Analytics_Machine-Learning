Your analysis should aim to identify any relationships or trends in the data that can be used to improve employee satisfaction and productivity. Evaluate the influence of data preparation for the use of Statistical Techniques and ML modelling outcomes. Communicate the results in a form of a report in the Jupyter notebook markdown of the analysis to stakeholders using clear and concise explanations, visualisations, and appropriate statistical terminology.
